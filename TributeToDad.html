            <h2 id="headline">Some information about Dad's life:</h2>
            <p>Dad was born April 6, 1939 in Brecknock Township, Lancaster County, PA. He was the youngest of 4 boys. 
              He grew up on a farm in the country and went to a one room schoolhouse from kindergarten through 8th grade. 
              Dad transferred to Governor Mifflin High School in Shillington to complete his high school education. What a 
              shock that must have been, going from a one room school to a large high school. Dad played baseball in high school.
            </p>

            <p>
              After high school dad worked at Bollman's Hat Factory and then at Becker's Garage. He eventually bought the garage 
              from Harry Becker, renamed it Lesher's Garage, and ran the business until he retired.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              He enjoyed playing softball, fishing, hunting and spending time with his family, especially his 2 grandsons.
            </p>  

            <p>  
              Dad was 81 when he passed away from congestive heart failure and is missed dearly!
